# holbertonschool-simple_shell

## Introduction
> Hey there:) Thanks for checking out our shell project! Here we have constructed our own simple shell that emulates the Bourne Again Shell.

## What is a shell?
A shell is a program that provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the computer's operating system. It allows users to execute commands and run programs by typing text commands.

### Program Files
File|Function|Prototype|
|----------|----------|-----------|
|[simple_shell.c](https://github.com/michaellgans/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/README.md)|`int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env)`|Main function/Source code
|[main.h](https://github.com/michaellgans/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/main.h)|Includes libraries, macros, and prototypes|Header file that provides futher instructions for program|
|[tokenize.c](https://github.com/michaellgans/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/tokenize.c)|`char **tokenize(char *string, char *delimiters, char **tokens_array)`|To break down input into smaller bits
|[find_path.c](https://github.com/michaellgans/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/find_path.c)|`int find_path(char **path_array, char **args_array)`|Finds the direction that program needs to go|
|[execute_program.c](https://github.com/michaellgans/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/execute_program.c)|`int execute_program(char *op_path, char **string_array)`|Executes a copy of the process|
|[free_helper.c](https://github.com/michaellgans/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/free_helper.c)|`void free_string_array(char **array)`|Function that is responsible for freeing memory|

##### Here is an example of a main file that can be used to test program
```
```
##### Use this to compile files
```
```

### Example for use of function
```
```
Results would look like:
